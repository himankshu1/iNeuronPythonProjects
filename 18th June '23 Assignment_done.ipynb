It allows developers to generate log messages at various levels of severity and store them in a designated log file or output them to the console.\n",

Logging provides a means to capture and store relevant information about user actions, system changes, and security events. Logging can serve as a valuable source of historical data that can be analyzed to gain insights into system behavior over time.\n",

Developers can use log messages to communicate important information between modules, services, or distributed systems.
